# How to Make Stuff That Makes Other Stuff Less Hard
#### [OIGC 2016](http://oigconf.com/)

## About

This repository contains all the code that was demonstrated at my talk in April 2016. Feel free to use any of this in your own projects. It's here for demonstration purposes. If you happen to find any bugs please feel free to report it and I will try to resolve it. 


This project was built and tested on Windows with Visual Studio 2015 but should work with Monodevelop on MacOS.
